# RAG_LLM_KYW

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation.

The code in the Jupyter notebook scrapes a website to create a custom dataset, takes a query, conducts a semantic text search for relevant text in the dataset, combines the resulting context and the query to create a prompt, and finally uses a completion model to generate a response to the prompt.

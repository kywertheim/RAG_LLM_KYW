# RAG_LLM_KYW

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Large Language Models (LLMs) & Text Generation.

The code in the Jupyter notebook has three parts. First, it scrapes a website to create a custom dataset. Second, it takes a query, conducts a semantic text search for relevant text in the dataset, and combines the resulting context with the query to create a prompt. Finally, it calls a completion model, which is a large language model, to generate a response to the prompt.

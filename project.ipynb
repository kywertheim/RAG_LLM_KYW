To me, the concepts of nationality, race, gender, and age; cultures and religions; and the institutions of marriage and family are relics of humanity\\'s tribal past. I do not approve of what creates conflicts and hinders evolution, so I do not define myself in such terms.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Please do not enquire about my origin. Being aracial and acultural, I do not have a home country and I refuse to celebrate any festivals. If you really need to know for practical reasons, the UK is my passport country. If you are a racist and as such need to know more, I am originally from Ethiopia: the cradle of <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Let us recognise our common roots in Africa.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>There are similarities between my belief in our potential to be more than our chromosomes and the transgender rights movement. It would therefore be hypocritical of me to not identify as non-binary in protest against patriarchy. My correct pronouns are they and them.</p>\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Early Life and Education (Until 2012)</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After an unremarkable childhood impeded by undiagnosed autism and my parents\\' mistake of sending me to school late, I immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK, but I refuse to be defined in relation to either place. My early development culminated in an angsty period at a boarding school in Kent. I was unhappy with the environment, but I could neither explain why nor change it. In retrospect, I was collecting data which I was not equipped to understand. Academically, I was very confused too. An internship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong introduced me to organic synthesis but put me off experimental work. On the other hand, my subject combination ruled out many theoretical disciplines. In the end, I picked chemical engineering only because it appeared to be an employable degree.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Ironically, this uninspired choice led me to my intellectual home. At Imperial College London, I began to form my worldview, became a yogi, and developed an interest in theoretical biology. My fellow chemical engineers and I learnt a key lesson from our time together. Given the right circumstances, genuine solidarity in the face of seemingly unbridgeable differences is possible. In order to venture into the life sciences from my chemical engineering background, I did a series of interdisciplinary research projects. While in Australia as an exchange student at the University of Sydney, I worked in bone tissue engineering. During an internship at the National University of La Plata in Argentina, I built quantitative structure-activity relationship models for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In my final year, I built a dynamic model of the unfolded protein response in the context of Alzheimer\\'s disease. I left Imperial with an MEng degree and more importantly, a desire to understand life in every sense of the word.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Finding my Feet (2012&#8211;2019)</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I started my quest to understand life in New York City on a shoestring budget. At Columbia University, I studied chemical engineering from a more theoretical perspective and was introduced to biophysics. Additionally, I was involved in two research projects about SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and nucleosome formation. In order to support myself financially, I worked as a teaching assistant for three semesters.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Although I had the option of doing a doctoral degree at Columbia, my department had a molecular bent, making it incompatible with my burgeoning interest in systems-level problems. I left Columbia with an MS degree and returned to England, transferring to the University of Southampton. In my years as a PhD candidate, I formulated a theory to explain lymphatic development. In the process, I learnt aspects of mathematical biology and applied mathematics. This period saw my growth into an independent and confident member of society. I partially made up for my embarrassment of not having worked part-time at school and university. At one point, I had three jobs on top of my degree. I also endured a cancer scare, took up painting, and began an amateur chess career. Towards the end of my graduate studies, as my views became clear, I intended to adopt the name 11250205 for the person I had become. First, like the transhumanist FM-2030, I wanted to protest against humanity\\'s collectivist mentality. Second, I wanted to protect the Chinese culture from appropriation. As the Home Office would sadly not recognise it, I took my current name in tribute to three people who had shaped me, to the belief that genuine human touches matter more than imposed ties. A few years later, it dawned on me that the Home Office is just another institution, so I began to go by the name of 11250205 too.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After becoming a doctor in bioengineering, I concluded that the stuggle to comprehend and manage complexity would define the 21st century. I was convinced that scientific computing was the best hope in this endeavour. I moved to the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln in the American Midwest to take my quest in this new direction. I moved into my unfurnished apartment with around 200 USD in my bank account, but thanks to the university\\'s campus card, I made it through the first month. In the next two years, I led the ambitious project of building a virtual immune system and living the good life in the Cornhusker State. In the course of the project, I supervised two PhD candidates and three undergraduate students. I also continued my education by completing two programmes: a whole-cell modelling workshop at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona and Udacity\\'s Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. In chess, I won the open U1600 section of the 2018 Cornhusker State Games: my first trophy.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>PRIMAGE (2019&#8211;2022)</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After laying the foundation of the virtual immune system&mdash;an achievement that won me the International Intellectual Benefits to Society Award from the Mensa Foundation&mdash;I wanted a new challenge, so I moved to the University of Sheffield to join PRIMAGE, a 10 million&#8211;euro Horizon 2020 project involving 16 institutions from eight European countries. We developed a cloud-based decision-making platform for the clinical management of malignant solid tumours. To this end, I built the first multicellular computational model of neuroblastoma and modelled DIPG\\'s invasive spread.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In parallel to PRIMAGE, I conceived three projects about the origin, nature, and treatment of neuroblastoma; secured small grants; and recruited students for the projects. In total, I supervised a PhD candidate, a master\\'s student, and eight undergraduate students in Sheffield. I also established international collaborations with the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy and St. Anna Children\\'s Cancer Research Institute in Austria. In order to bolster my skill set, I took a series of bioinformatics courses offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. In 2021, I taught a part of the course titled Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems at the university.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had time for introspection. Reflecting on my firsthand experience of intersectional discrimination crystallised my long-standing concern for social justice in academia. In 2020, I joined the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Committee of the Department of Computer Science, contributing a little to the renewal of its Athena SWAN Silver Award for another five years in 2021. I became increasingly conscious of patriarchy too, including my own complicity in it. This process culminated in my outright rejection of all genders and hence my male privileges in late 2021.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Independence (2023&#8211;)</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In January 2023, I joined the University of Hull as a lecturer (assistant professor): my first independent academic position. At the Centre of Excellence for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Modelling, I am running a research programme investigating biological and social systems. In parallel, I passively offer consultancy services to researchers who require AI expertise for their projects, mostly in healthcare and biomedical research.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>My department delivers a conversion MSc degree programme in artificial intelligence and data science. I teach the Applied AI module and give guest lectures on cancer modelling. Furthermore, I propose and/or supervise a broad range of dissertation projects every academic year. In preparation for my teaching duties, I have completed courses in computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, generative AI, and reinforcement learning via Udacity and Coursera. In February 2024, I became a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Immediately after moving to Hull, I became my department\\'s EDI champion to continue my advocacy and began my 200-hour yoga teacher training with Ann-Marie Mainprize. In October 2023, 15 years after my first yoga class, I became a qualified instructor. At the University of Hull, I have raised awareness of EDI issues such as linguistic justice and microaggressions, speaking at internal conferences, giving departmental seminars, and leading induction sessions.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Further Information</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"personal/cv.pdf\">My full CV</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywertheim\">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Wertheim\">ResearchGate</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8XSXXqMAAAAJ&hl=en\">Google Scholar</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-2898\">ORCID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/2134562\">ResearcherID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kywertheim\">GitHub</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yogapona.com\">Yoga Pona</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"footer\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Copyright &#x000A9;&nbsp;2017&#8211;2024 Kenneth Y.

In this period, I was supported by an EPSRC studentship awarded by the Faculty of Engineering and the Environment; it covered my tuition, research-related expenses, and a stipend. To facilitate my thesis research, I took courses in numerical methods and mathematical biology in the mathematics department. I was also involved in the yoga society and chess club at the university. I defended my thesis successfully less than three years after starting the degree in February in 2014. My thesis title is <i>Mathematical Modelling of Lymphangiogenesis</i>.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Master of Science (MS), Chemical Engineering, 3.60/4.00</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>When I was a graduate student at Columbia University in the City of New York in the USA, I was supported by a departmental scholarship, which covered my tuition, fees, and a stipend. I took advanced courses in transport phenomena, chemical kinetics, and thermodynamics, as well as a general research methodology course in my department. I went way beyond my comfort zone by taking graduate-level courses in other departments even though I did not have the prerequisites, including partial differential equations (applied maths), statistical mechanics (applied physics), quantitative methods in cell biology (interdisciplinary), and molecular biophysics (biochemistry and molecular biophysics). I developed my research interests further through research projects in the areas of biophysics, image analysis, and molecular simulation. After passing my qualifying examination and getting the MS degree, I was offered the option to pursue a funded doctoral degree in the department. However, I transferred to Southampton to work on developmental biology after fall 2013.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Master of Engineering (MEng), Chemical Engineering, First-Class Honours</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Between 2008 and 2012, I was an undergraduate student at Imperial College London, where I received a solid education in chemical engineering, including courses, lab work, and group projects. I also took an elective course in biomechanics in the bioengineering department. In my final year, I was involved in two major projects. In the first term, a lab partner and I completed a research project about Alzheimer\\'s disease. In the second term, I worked with nine coursemates to design a process with an annual capacity of 515 tonnes of S-ibuprofen&#8211;S-lysine. Throughout the degree, I was inspired by my personal tutor, Doctor Jawahar Krishnan, to develop my interest in theoretical biology. I helped run the yoga club at Imperial too. I graduated with an integrated master\\'s degree.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Exchange Year, Chemical Engineering, First-Class Honours</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>On the strength of my academic excellence and performance at a panel interview, I was awarded a tuition fee waiver (50 %) by Imperial College London to spend the 2010&#8211;2011 academic year at the University of Sydney in Australia. In addition to chemical engineering courses, I took electives in biochemical engineering, cellular biophysics, and membrane science. During the Christmas/summer holiday, I worked in a tissue engineering research group. My grade was converted by Imperial College London according to an official scale.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>International Baccalaureate, 44/45</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>From 2006 to 2008, I attended Sevenoaks School, a boarding school in the UK. I studied mathematics (higher level), chemistry (higher level), biology (higher level), economics (standard level), Mandarin (standard level B), English literature (standard level A1), and theory of knowledge. While researching for my extended essay, I used high-performance liquid chromatography to find out the caffeine levels in different energy drinks. I won the Science Faculty, GlaxoSmithKline Science, and Mathematics Prizes. I was a part of the school ground force and the chairman of my house. In 2007, I took part in the UK Senior Mathematical Challenge and won a gold certificate, thus earning an invitation to participate in the 2007/08 British Mathematical Olympiad. I also entered a science essay competition organised by Peterhouse, Cambridge and won a commendation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Certificates</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Deep Reinforcement Learning: Value-Based Methods</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I completed this Udacity course in December 2024. After learning how reinforcement learning problems can be modelled as Markov decision processes, I learnt value-based methods for policy optimisation, including the Monte Carlo control method, Sarsa, Sarsamax (Q-learning), expected Sarsa, and deep Q-learning.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After that, I completed another uncertified course. I learnt policy-based methods, including hill climbing, steepest ascent hill climbing, simulated annealing, adaptive noise scaling, the cross-entropy method, evolution strategies, REINFORCE (policy gradient method), and proximal policy optimisation. I also learnt to combine value-based and policy-based methods in actor-critic methods, including A3C and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Communicating with Natural Language</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I completed this Udacity course in September 2024. I was introduced to the automatic speech recognition pipeline, including audio signal analysis (spectrogram and MFCC), acoustic modelling (hidden Markov models), language modelling (N-grams), deep neural networks, and connectionist temporal classification.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I completed this Udacity course in August 2024. I learnt to use region-based CNNs and YOLO for object detection, as well as RNN-CNN models for image captioning.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Mental Health First Aider (MHFAider&#174;)</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In July 2024, I completed MHFA England\\'s two-day mental health first aid course. I learnt the role of a mental health first aider, what mental health is, some signs of poor/ill mental health, some risk/protective factors associated with poor/good mental health, self-care, and the ALGEE action plan. I learnt some tools to implement the action plan too, including active listening, the focus technique, and helpful language about mental health.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Introduction to Computer Vision</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In November and December 2023, I was introduced to the fundamentals of computer vision in this Udacity course, such as colour space conversions, smoothing, edge detection, shape detection (Hough transform and corner detection), erosion, dilation, image segmentation (contouring and clustering), object recognition (Haar cascades), and feature extraction (ORB and HOG). Then, I learnt to build convolutional neural networks and visualise their features.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Building Generative Adversarial Networks</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In September and October 2023, I learnt to build various types of generative adversarial networks in this Udacity course, including the basic GAN, DCGAN, CGAN, CycleGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, ProGAN, and StyleGAN.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>200-Hour Yoga Teacher Training</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I completed my training under the tutelage of Ann-Marie Mainprize in 2023. My peers and I spent 10 months studying over 120 <i>asanas</i> and therapeutic techniques, intelligent sequencing, <i>pranayama</i>, meditation and relaxation techniques, functional anatomy, subtle anatomy, physiology, and yoga philosophy. Through micro-teaching and receiving feedback from each other, we developed practical skills in demonstration, providing verbal cues, alignment awareness, adjustment, and modification. In October 2023, 15 years after my first yoga class, I was certified by Yoga Alliance Professionals as a registered yoga teacher 200RYT. This accreditation is an internationally recognised qualification.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Natural Language Processing Specialisation</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the summer of 2023, I completed a series of NLP courses offered by DeepLearning.AI via Coursera. In the first course, I mastered the fundamentals of NLP, including text preprocessing techniques, logistic regression (sentiment analysis), Naive Bayes classification (sentiment analysis), word vectors (embeddings), principal component analysis, the bag-of-words model, the k-nearest neighbours algorithm, and locality-sensitive hashing. In the second course, I learnt to use dynamic programming for autocorrection, hidden Markov models for part-of-speech tagging, n-grams language models to autocomplete sentences, and CBOW models to compute word embeddings. In the third course, I became conversant with the use of deep neural networks for NLP. I built a feedforward network for sentiment analysis, a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units for autocompletion, a long short-term memory network to locate and classify named entities, and a Siamese network comprising two LSTM subnetworks to identify duplicate questions. In the final course, I was introduced to the attention mechanism and several transformers. I built an encoder-decoder model comprising LSTMs and the scaled dot product attention mechanism for English-to-German translation, a transformer decoder using the masked self-attention (autoregressive or causal attention) mechanism for text summarisation, a transformer encoder (BERT) for question answering, and a chatbot based on the reformer model.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Genomic Data Science Specialisation</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>At different points in 2020 and 2021, I took a set of bioinformatics courses offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. I learnt about genomic technologies such as WGS, WES, RNASeq, ChIPSeq, and bisulfite sequencing; algorithms for sequence alignment and assembly; bioinformatics pipelines such as variant calling and the Tuxedo pipeline for RNASeq data; biostatistics; and bioinformatics tools including the Galaxy platform, Bash scripting, Bioconductor, R, and Python. I secured a development opportunity grant from the Engineering Researcher Society of the University of Sheffield to fund the courses.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Between March and November in 2018, I completed this Udacity programme. I took courses in supervised (regression and classification), unsupervised (clustering and dimensionality reduction), deep, and reinforcement learning. Then, I designed and implemented a capstone project, carrying out a series of studies using a dataset from a pan-cancer analysis of paediatric cancers.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Whole-Cell Modelling Workshop</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>While working at the University of Nebraska&#8211;Lincoln, I was awarded a travel grant to attend a whole-cell modelling workshop at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona, Spain in September 2017. I learnt multiple modelling techniques and how to combine them to describe a cell holistically.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Test Scores</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Cattell Culture Fair III A Intelligence Test, 157</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Percentile rank: 99.

A system consists of components interacting within its boundary with the rest of the universe (environment). A complex system has an extra constraint; its properties and behaviours cannot be predicted from those of its components in isolation. They arise from intercomponent interactions in a phenomenon known as emergence.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Four important emergent behaviours are self-organisation, hysteresis, adaptation, and nonlinearity. Self-organisation means unplanned order; hysteresis means a system\\'s state depends on its history; adaptation results in resilience despite environmental changes; nonlinearity means a systemic output is not proportional to a relevant environmental input. They are possible because of properties such as agency, heterogeneity, control loops, nested structures, and open boundaries.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Complex systems are found in many disciplines. Prominent examples include chemical plants, embryos, immune systems, tumours, nervous systems, ecosystems, stock markets, social groups, and languages. I mostly study biological and social systems, but I develop applications of artificial intelligence too.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Ongoing</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"schelling.html\">Social dynamics in linguistically diverse communities.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"MAT.html\">A theoretical study of evolutionary therapy for neuroblastoma.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"DAIM.html\">Applications of artificial intelligence.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Completed</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"MYCN.html\">A theoretical study of the MYCN enigma in neuroblastoma.</a></li>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"primage.html\">Predictive <i>in silico</i> multiscale analytics to support cancer personalised diagnosis and prognosis, empowered by imaging biomarkers (PRIMAGE).</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"NBclonal.html\">Modelling neuroblastoma\\'s clonal evolution during chemotherapy.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"crest.html\">Understanding neural crest development at the intracellular level.</a></li>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"immune.html\">Development of a virtual immune system.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"MLcapstone.html\">Classification and clustering of paediatric cancers.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"lymph.html\">Mathematical modelling of lymphangiogenesis.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"earlyprojects.html\">Earlier projects.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Advocacy</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Although I identify as aracial, acultural, and agender&mdash;a global citizen without a home country&mdash;I cannot prevent people from stereotyping me as an East Asian male. My quest to understand life has taken me around the world twice, but my sense of alienation is a constant. It is the intersectional product of my first-generation immigrant background, minority ethnic background, academic nomadism, autism, social class dissonance, and to a lesser extent, my discomfort with patriarchy. Motivated by my lived experiences of being an outsider, I advocate social justice in education. An issue that concerns me above all is linguistic oppression.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Ongoing</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"EDIcourse.html\">Topics in equality, diversity, and inclusion.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"AlumMentor.html\">Mentoring schemes.</a></li>\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Completed</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"EDIShef.html\">Equality, diversity, and inclusion at the University of Sheffield.</a></li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Yoga</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Since I first became a yogi in 2008, it has been a big part of my life.

The most famous example is adaptive therapy, which uses treatment-sensitive cancer cells to suppress their resistant peers. This project aims to investigate evolutionary therapy in the context of neuroblastoma.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After conceiving the project, I established an international collaboration with Dr Sabine Taschner-Mandl from St. Anna Children\\'s Cancer Research Institute. Dr Matishalin Patel, an expert in evolutionary biology and a departmental colleague at the University of Hull, and I secured a DAIM PhD studentship through a competitive process to fund this project. In January 2024, Francesca Covell became our first PhD candidate (AI and Data Science).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Fran is interested in neuroblastoma\\'s phenotypic plasticity in this context. She has already built a model describing neuroblastoma cells\\' interconversion between the noradrenergic, intermediate, and mesenchymal identities with ordinary differential equations. Using the model, she is now investigating the effects of inhibiting different interconversion pathways on clonal evolution during treatment. Typically, noradrenergic neuroblastoma cells are more sensitive to treatment, but Dr Taschner-Mandl is developing mesenchymal phenotype&#8211;specific inhibitors. The goal is to manipulate a tumour\\'s interconversion dynamics to steer its evolution towards a state where it is vulnerable to certain drugs.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Other phenomena await explanation too. Most if not all of the existing models of adaptive therapy consider two drugs only, but the rapid COJEC protocol for induction chemotherapy alone requires five drugs. Multidrug adaptive therapy can certainly benefit from a more general theoretical framework. Spatial and stochastic effects, as well as various non-cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment, complicate the dynamics further.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/CancerModel.jpg\" alt=\"Cancer modelling\" height=\"523\" width=\"500\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Further Information</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"personal/cv.pdf\">My full CV</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywertheim\">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Wertheim\">ResearchGate</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8XSXXqMAAAAJ&hl=en\">Google Scholar</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-2898\">ORCID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/2134562\">ResearcherID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kywertheim\">GitHub</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yogapona.com\">Yoga Pona</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"footer\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Copyright &#x000A9;&nbsp;2017&#8211;2024 Kenneth Y.

Influenced by this intellectual environment, I began to work in applied artificial intelligence in parallel to systems research.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Real-Time 3D Reconstruction from 2D Human Images</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I am the secondary supervisor of Gulraiz Khan, a PhD candidate. He developed a deep learning framework to predict the facial landmarks, ages, and genders of human face images. It has a backbone model (ResNet-18) for feature extraction. It is linked to three branches of lightweight neural networks, which share the convolutional feature maps produced by the backbone model in response to an image. They predict the image\\'s facial landmarks, age, and gender respectively. He is now solving the problem of real-time, identity-aware, and clothing-aware 3D reconstruction.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Platelet Proteomes</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Platelets are small blood cells that play a key role in blood clotting (haemostasis). On the other hand, uncontrolled platelet activation could result in thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel, which obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Multiple stimulatory and inhibitory signalling pathways interact within a platelet to enable it to adapt to a changing extracellular environment. For example, its proteome may change in response to oxidative stresses. Dr Giordano Pula (Hull York Medical School) and I are interested in identifying such changes and then interpreting them in functional terms.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In diabetics, platelets are known to be hyper-responsive and responsible for cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral tissue ischemia. In the autumn trimester in 2023, Shaon Biswas conducted his MSc dissertation research (AI and Data Science) under our supervision at the University of Hull. He used the Enrichr library, the KEGG database, and the UniProt database to identify the platelet proteins associated with cardiovascular complications in a proteomic dataset pertaining to 23 diabetic (type 2) patients and 24 controls. Using this list of proteins as his reference, he combined standard differential expression analysis with protein-protein network analysis (STRING database), feature importance analysis (random forest classification), clustering, principal component analysis, and association rule learning to identify novel platelet protein biomarkers of cardiovascular complications in diabetics.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/amino.png\" alt=\"Amino acids\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>MSc Projects</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Our MSc degree programme in artificial intelligence and data science includes a dissertation project. Throughout the academic year, I propose and/or supervise these projects. Sometimes, our students design their own projects. Sometimes, we collaborate with external partners.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>My students and I have developed applications of artificial intelligence in areas such as healthcare, sport science, platelet proteomics, cancer transcriptomics, fintech, medical image classification, patient record classification, retrieval-augmented generation, optical character recognition, image captioning, multimodal sentiment analysis, dysarthric speech recognition, and optimisation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the summer trimester of 2023, I supervised 14 projects, including collaborative projects with the Academic Vascular Surgical Unit (AVSU) of Hull Royal Infirmary, a tertiary teaching hospital run by an NHS hospital trust. Enoch Appiah built an image processing pipeline and a CNN-LSTM model to digitise handwritten clinical notes. He won the Best MSc Research Project Prize. Folakemi Fatiregun built an AI system to allocate hospital beds. Partly on the strength of her impressive dissertation, she secured a full-time position as an information analyst at the same NHS trust.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the autumn trimester of 2023, I supervised 12 projects. Mustabshira Zia built an automatic speech recognition system for dysarthric people. Esther Chukwuezi experimented with diverse dimensionality reduction techniques to optimise risk prediction based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing data about people with heart failure.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the summer trimester of 2024, I supervised three projects, including two collaborative projects with Spencer Group, a civil engineering company in Hull.

This is not surprising because it activates genes involved in metastasis, survival, proliferation, pluripotency, self-renewal, and angiogenesis, while switching off genes involved in differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and immune surveillance. However, the abundance of MYCN\\'s mRNA in a tumour is a non-linear prognostic indicator. The MYCN enigma is the general observation that a patient\\'s clinical outcome does not linearly depend on whether the gene is amplified and the abundance of its mRNA in their neuroblastoma cells.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>During the PRIMAGE project, I conceived this side project to find a theoretical solution to the MYCN enigma. Specifically, I wanted to develop an explanation in terms of the fact that MYCN activates p53 (a tumour suppressor gene) through the ARF/MDM2/p53 axis. In order to fund it, I secured two Insigneo research grants.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Mathematical Modelling</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the summer of 2019, I recruited Daniel Jordan, a mechatronics and robotics engineering undergraduate student, to work on the project at the University of Sheffield. Together, we used a set of ordinary differential equations to model the crosstalk between MYCN and the ARF/MDM2/p53 axis, and performed a basic analysis on the fixed points.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the academic year 2019&#8211;2020, Melody Parker, an MSc computational medicine student at the University of Sheffield, joined the project for her dissertation research. Under the supervision of Dr Dawn Walker and me, she picked up where Dan had left off, enriching the model with mechanistic details concerning various stages in the flow of genetic information. Using eight equations containing highly non-linear terms such as the Hill function, she modelled the dynamics within a gene regulatory network representing these mechanisms.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Phase Space Analysis</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the summer of 2021, Rory Deignan, an undergraduate (theoretical physics) at the University of Sheffield, built computational tools for a large-scale stability analysis of the model. He combined Latin hypercube sampling with the Newton-Raphson algorithm to find physical and well-scaled fixed points and classify them. He also experimented with spectral and fractal analysis tools.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In 2023, I recruited Matteo Italia, a PhD candidate under Dr Fabio Dercole at the Polytechnic University of Milan. We hypothesised that the protein level of p53 relative to that of MYCN determines a neuroblastoma cell\\'s fate. We parameterised the model with literature values before conducting a global sensitivity analysis. We partitioned the simulation results into different categories based on our hypothesis and compared each set of results with experimental datasets. We also applied the Apriori algorithm to find association rules in each set of simulation results.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Overall, the simulation results align with numerous findings in the literature, including both broad observations and specific experimental results. Most importantly, by partitioning the simulation results according to our hypothesis, we were able to reproduce an experimental dataset closely associated with the MYCN enigma.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/MYCN.png\" alt=\"Network\" height=\"444\" width=\"630\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Further Information</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"personal/cv.pdf\">My full CV</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywertheim\">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Wertheim\">ResearchGate</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8XSXXqMAAAAJ&hl=en\">Google Scholar</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-2898\">ORCID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/2134562\">ResearcherID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kywertheim\">GitHub</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yogapona.com\">Yoga Pona</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"footer\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Copyright &#x000A9;&nbsp;2017&#8211;2024 Kenneth Y.

It was launched by 16 institutions from eight European countries to build a cloud-based decision-making platform for the clinical management of malignant solid tumours, specifically predictive tools for diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic choices, and treatment follow-up, including novel imaging biomarkers, <i>in silico</i> tumour growth simulation methods, advanced visualisation techniques, and machine learning tools.

Each voxel is associated with an amount of extracellular matrix, a neuroblastoma cell count, and a Schwann cell count. The grid is itself associated with a homogeneous amount of oxygen and nutrients, as well as an extent of inflammation. The major agent behaviours are cell cycling and cell death. These are regulated by the microenvironment and each agent\\'s internal attributes. For example, hypoxia can damage an agent\\'s DNA and thus induce apoptosis, but the agent can repair its DNA if p53 is active. Some of the regulatory mechanisms are double-edged. For example, an apoptotic or necrotic agent is easier to remove in a more inflamed microenvironment, but inflammation also leads to further necrosis. The two agent populations interact via the continuous automaton, which records their spatial distributions. While neuroblastoma cells promote cell cycle progression in Schwann cells, Schwann cells induce apoptosis and differentiation in neuroblastoma cells; a more differentiated neuroblastoma cell is less proliferative. When two agents overlap, contact inhibition stops cell cycling and matrix production. The centre-based mechanical model resolves the conflict.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Then, I aggregated data about neuroblastoma\\'s histology, mutations, hypoxia, and growth kinetics. Together, the tumour\\'s histology type and mutation profile determine the split between the two agent populations, the differentiation state of the neuroblastoma cell population, their ability to repair telomeres, and their cell cycling rate. I developed a tournament-style pipeline based on Latin hypercube sampling to calibrate the model on the basis of the aggregated data.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Using the calibrated model, I simulated the dynamics of clonal competition within heterogeneous tumours and evaluated combinations of targeted therapies on the GPUs on the Bessemer high-performance computing cluster. I analysed the resulting datasets by dimensionality reduction, clustering, and hypothesis testing. I theorised about an unconventional therapy based on targeting p53\\'s regulators. Although <i>p53</i> is usually considered a tumour suppressor gene, the protein it encodes repairs damaged DNA too. My theory is that p53 is on balance pro-apoptosis in most neuroblastoma cells, but a typical tumour contains a small portion of cells wherein it is pro-survival. It follows from my theory that the usual strategy of activating <i>p53</i> and stabilising p53 is incomplete. An adaptive approach is worth exploring.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>To accelerate the costly simulations, I built surrogate models by multiple linear regression and deep learning.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In parallel, I collaborated with the University of Zaragoza, University of Bologna, and Chemotargets SL to integrate the calibrated model with their organ-scale and single-cell models with a new scale separation method.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/vis_model2.gif\" alt=\"tumour\" height=\"288\" width=\"432\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In June 2021, Will Shaw, a computer science undergraduate student at our university, joined Dr Walker and me for a summer project funded by the SURE (Sheffield Undergraduate Research Experiences) scheme.

After that, we learnt to use genetic algorithms to optimise drug combination and scheduling.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the academic year 2020&#8211;2021, Ritvik Mehra carried out his undergraduate thesis research (computer science) at the University of Sheffield under Dr Dawn Walker\\'s and my supervision. He used four ordinary differential equations inspired by the logistic function to model neuroblastoma\\'s clonal evolution under the selective pressures exerted by etoposide and cisplatin. Then, he fitted the model to experimental data in the literature using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and designed a genetic algorithm to optimise the combination of the two drugs.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After Ritvik\\'s thesis research, I established international collaborations with Dr Fabio Dercole from the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy and Dr Sabine Taschner-Mandl from St. Anna Children\\'s Cancer Research Institute in Austria. Under our supervision, Matteo Italia, Dr Dercole\\'s PhD student (engineering mathematics), modified and expanded Ritvik\\'s model to consider clonal competition, mutation, pharmacokinetics, and the drugs\\' cytotoxic effects. In the final model, each clone has its own fitness, proliferation rate, and drug sensitivities; and it can adapt to a drug at the expense of proliferation. As he found more relevant data on vincristine and cyclophosphamide than etoposide and cisplatin, Matteo calibrated the model to describe the former pair.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Then, we used genetic and gradient descent algorithms to optimise induction chemotherapy, the first stage of the multimodal therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma patients. We discovered different evolutionary dynamics in tumours with different resistance profiles. According to the results, when two drugs are differentially cytotoxic, administering both at their maximum tolerated doses is not always the best strategy. The best strategy depends on each drug\\'s relative cytotoxicity, each clone\\'s sensitivity to each drug, and the precise clonal composition.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the broader context of precision medicine for neuroblastoma, our results suggest that evolutionary dynamics are patient-specific and as a result, personalised schedules are needed to exploit clonal competition optimally to minimise the tumour size. As chemotherapy is known to enrich mutations, not only can this approach optimise induction chemotherapy, but it can also drive the tumour into an evolutionary trap and extinction vortex simultaneously. Immediately after the optimised induction phase, the remaining small and scattered populations of cancer cells will be vulnerable to therapies targeting the enriched mutations.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>We finished the project in December 2022.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/CEmutation.png\" alt=\"CEmutation\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Further Information</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"personal/cv.pdf\">My full CV</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywertheim\">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Wertheim\">ResearchGate</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8XSXXqMAAAAJ&hl=en\">Google Scholar</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-2898\">ORCID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/2134562\">ResearcherID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kywertheim\">GitHub</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yogapona.com\">Yoga Pona</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"footer\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Copyright &#x000A9;&nbsp;2017&#8211;2024 Kenneth Y.

Its development spans gastrulation, neurulation, and organogenesis. It can be divided into five steps: neural border induction, neural crest induction, epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT), migration, and final differentiation into diverse tissues including the sympathoadrenal lineage.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>It is known that amplification of the MYCN oncogene and activating mutations of the ALK oncogene can transform neural crest progenitor cells into neuroblastoma cells, which can interconvert between two phenotypes, N-type (adrenergic) and S-type (mesenchymal) cells, which have different levels of chemoresistance and invasive properties.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>While working on the PRIMAGE project, I became interested in identifying the exact developmental step where this transformation occurs and explaining it in terms of intracellular molecular details. I conceived this project and secured an Insigneo research grant to fund it.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>First Approach</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the academic year 2019&#8211;2020, Jack Ashurst carried out his undergraduate thesis research (computer science) at the University of Sheffield. Doctor Dawn Walker and I co-supervised him. He modelled the first two steps with a top-down approach. Within a minimalist Boolean network, he connected the BMP, Wnt, FGF, and Notch signalling pathways to the neural border and neural crest specifiers, which constitute a gene regulatory network. He searched for attractors under a synchronous updating scheme and an asynchronous one. He reproduced two experiments: the model\\'s inductive signals upregulated the specifiers therein and a knock-down experiment.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>The neural border specifiers were known to switch off after the second step, so he perturbed an attractor by withdrawing the inductive signals and overexpressing MYCN in the model. Despite an upregulated MYCN, the neural border specifiers failed to stay active in the model. It is possible that MYCN amplification does not impair the first two steps. However, a more plausible reason is that some regulatory mechanisms are elusive. Related is the fact that multiple events occur in each step; their regulatory mechanisms overlap but differ.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>A Different Perspective</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After considering Jack\\'s results, I decided to switch to a bottom-up approach and focus on a well-characterised fundamental process carried out by neural crest progenitor cells: asymmetric division.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In 2022, Alvaro Andre Yupanqui Rivera, an undergraduate bioengineer, joined the project as an Insigneo summer intern. Within a probabilistic Boolean network, we modelled the intracellular mechanism regulating this process.

The goal was to represent the constituting cells and molecules of the human immune system logically in space, time, and in relation to each other. The project was conceived and directed by Professor Tomas Helikar.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the first phase of the project, I built a multiscale model of CD4+ T lymphocytes by leveraging logical modelling (Boolean networks), constraint-based modelling, agent-based modelling, and ordinary differential equations. In this model, the cells are represented by discrete agents and the relevant cytokines are described by continuous concentrations; both are distributed in three compartments representing the whole body. Within each agent, signal transduction, gene regulation, and metabolism are integrated in a logical model coupled to genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I wrote an algorithm to implement the model, combining a Monte Carlo method, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, linear programming, and a finite difference method. Armed with this algorithm, I carried out computer simulations to validate the model and make predictions. Based on the results, I proposed novel emergent switch-like and oscillatory behaviours for CD4+ T cells.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the second phase, I added more agent types to the framework encompassing the model, including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, basophils, and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Although I left the project after laying the foundation of the virtual immune system, I remain available in a consulting capacity.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In the course of this project, I worked with two PhD candidates (Aimee Kessell and Sydney Townsend) and three undergraduate students (Alyssa La Fleur, Robert Moore, and Bailee Lichter).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Here is a presentation about this project: <a href=\"/research/ISMB2018_talk.pdf\">slides</a> and <a href=\"/research/ISMB2018_recording.mp4\">video recording</a>.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/AwardMensa.png\" alt=\"AwardMensa\" height=\"665\" width=\"651\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/BN.jpg\" alt=\"Boolean network\" height=\"400\" width=\"533\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Further Information</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"personal/cv.pdf\">My full CV</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywertheim\">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Wertheim\">ResearchGate</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8XSXXqMAAAAJ&hl=en\">Google Scholar</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-2898\">ORCID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/2134562\">ResearcherID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kywertheim\">GitHub</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yogapona.com\">Yoga Pona</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"footer\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Copyright &#x000A9;&nbsp;2017&#8211;2024 Kenneth Y.

Aided by COMSOL Multiphysics, I carried out multiple numerical experiments by solving the model by the finite element method.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>After that, I simplified the model to four equations. In order to assess the potential of Turing pattern formation in the embryo, I wrote an algorithm to sample the parametric space of the simplified model.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Based on my results, I proposed a theory about lymphangiogenesis. According to my theory, VEGFC is a morphogen for the precursors of lymphatic endothelial cells, but a different molecule is needed to guide their migration. The patterning function of VEGFC depends on its interactions with collagen I and MMP2.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Here is a presentation about the project: <a href=\"research/lymph.preso.pdf\">link</a>.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<img src=\"photos/equation1.jpg\" alt=\"Equation\" height=\"400\" width=\"400\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Further Information</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"personal/cv.pdf\">My full CV</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywertheim\">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Wertheim\">ResearchGate</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8XSXXqMAAAAJ&hl=en\">Google Scholar</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-2898\">ORCID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/2134562\">ResearcherID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kywertheim\">GitHub</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yogapona.com\">Yoga Pona</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"footer\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Copyright &#x000A9;&nbsp;2017&#8211;2024 Kenneth Y.

Thanks to the generosity, patience, and tolerance of many mentors, I had the good fortune to dabble in an eclectic mix of research projects without the pressure of expectation.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Molecular Simulation of Nucleosomes</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In my second and third semesters (January to December 2013) at Columbia, I worked in Doctor Vanessa Ortiz\\'s research group. I helped a senior colleague set up MD simulations and alchemical FEP calculations within NAMD. After analysing the data by TCL scripting, I predicted the solvent accessible surface areas of the phosphate groups and the nucleotide distributions in nucleosome-forming DNA fragments.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Image and Quantitative Analysis of SNARE-Mediated Membrane Fusion</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In my first semester (September to December 2012) at Columbia University in the City of New York, I worked in Professor Ben O\\'Shaughnessy\\'s research group. I worked with Doctor Ben Stratton, a PhD candidate then, to study SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. I used Speckle TrackerJ, an ImageJ plugin, to analyse TIRFM images of a microfluidic setup, quantifying lipid motion and vesicle fusion with a phospholipid bilayer. From the data, I calculated the average diffusion coefficient and bleaching time of lipid, and then inferred the vesicles\\' size distribution.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Simulation of the ER Stress Response in Alzheimer\\'s Disease</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>In my final year at Imperial College London, I completed a research project under the supervision of Professor Cleo Kontoravdi. Between October and December in 2011, a lab partner and I constructed a mathematical model (ordinary differential equations) of the PERK-mediated branch of the unfolded protein response, and performed gPROMS-aided computer simulations of the progression of Alzheimer\\'s disease.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>QSAR Analysis of Tacrine-Related Compounds for the Treatment of Alzheimer\\'s Disease</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I was nominated by IAESTE UK and funded by IAESTE Argentina to intern at the Research Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physical Chemistry in La Plata, Argentina from July to September in 2011. Under the supervision of Professor Pablo Duchowicz and Doctor Andrew Mercader from Professor Eduardo Castro\\'s group, I constructed 10 QSAR models by multiple linear regression. The models predict the activities of tacrine-related acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of Alzheimer\\'s disease.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Preparation and Characterisation of Novel Magnesium Silicate Scaffolds for Bone Tissue Engineering</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Between November 2010 and March 2011, I volunteered in Professor Hala Zreiqat\\'s Biomaterial and Tissue Engineering Research Unit, a part of the University of Sydney. I worked with Doctor Iman Roohani, a PhD candidate then, to prepare strontium-doped magnesium silicate scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications, and determine their chemical compositions by X-ray diffraction.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>Organic Synthesis</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>I guess it was not exactly a research project. When I was still a sixth-former in the UK, I reached out to Professor Henry N.C. Wong in Hong Kong. After convincing him of my academic potential, I earned a paid internship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Between July and August in 2007, I assisted Doctor Sam C.K. Hau (a PhD candidate then) in labour-intensive and hands-on tasks in Professor Wong\\'s organic synthesis laboratory. Although the underlying science was way beyond my comprehension, I learnt some practical experimental techniques and experienced the day-to-day happenings in academic life.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h2>Further Information</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<ul>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"personal/cv.pdf\">My full CV</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kywertheim\">LinkedIn</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Wertheim\">ResearchGate</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8XSXXqMAAAAJ&hl=en\">Google Scholar</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4152-2898\">ORCID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.webofscience.com/wos/author/record/2134562\">ResearcherID</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://github.com/kywertheim\">GitHub</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<li><a href=\"https://www.yogapona.com\">Yoga Pona</a>.</li>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</ul>\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"footer\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Copyright &#x000A9;&nbsp;2017&#8211;2024 Kenneth Y.

A memorable moment.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>16/01/2023</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Today, I started my lectureship (assistant professorship) at the University of Hull: my first independent academic position. I am a part of the Centre of Excellence for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Modelling.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Now that I hold a position that makes me a potential role model for young people, I will pay more attention to my behaviour. Partly due to autism, I have experienced meltdowns triggered by overwhelming situations, especially flashbacks of injustices. During these episodes, I might have lost behavioural control. I certainly have done and said things that I regret, such as name-calling and swearing. Of course, my being autistic is not an excuse for my past acts and words, but now that I know better and have the necessary coping mechanisms, I can manage an overwhelming situation more effectively. Starting from today, I will think twice before communicating my thoughts.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<h3>13/01/2023</h3>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>Yesterday, I had my last day at the University of Sheffield.

I do not approve of what creates conflicts and hinders evolution, so I do not define myself in such terms.\", 'Please do not enquire about my origin. Being aracial and acultural, I do not have a home country and I refuse to celebrate any festivals. If you really need to know for practical reasons, the UK is my passport country. If you are a racist and as such need to know more, I am originally from Ethiopia: the cradle ofHomo sapiens. Let us recognise our common roots in Africa.', 'There are similarities between my belief in our potential to be more than our chromosomes and the transgender rights movement. It would therefore be hypocritical of me to not identify as non-binary in protest against patriarchy. My correct pronouns are they and them.', \"After an unremarkable childhood impeded by undiagnosed autism and my parents' mistake of sending me to school late, I immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK, but I refuse to be defined in relation to either place. My early development culminated in an angsty period at a boarding school in Kent. I was unhappy with the environment, but I could neither explain why nor change it. In retrospect, I was collecting data which I was not equipped to understand. Academically, I was very confused too. An internship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong introduced me to organic synthesis but put me off experimental work. On the other hand, my subject combination ruled out many theoretical disciplines. In the end, I picked chemical engineering only because it appeared to be an employable degree.\", \"Ironically, this uninspired choice led me to my intellectual home. At Imperial College London, I began to form my worldview, became a yogi, and developed an interest in theoretical biology. My fellow chemical engineers and I learnt a key lesson from our time together. Given the right circumstances, genuine solidarity in the face of seemingly unbridgeable differences is possible. In order to venture into the life sciences from my chemical engineering background, I did a series of interdisciplinary research projects. While in Australia as an exchange student at the University of Sydney, I worked in bone tissue engineering. During an internship at the National University of La Plata in Argentina, I built quantitative structure-activity relationship models for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In my final year, I built a dynamic model of the unfolded protein response in the context of Alzheimer's disease. I left Imperial with an MEng degree and more importantly, a desire to understand life in every sense of the word.\", 'I started my quest to understand life in New York City on a shoestring budget. At Columbia University, I studied chemical engineering from a more theoretical perspective and was introduced to biophysics. Additionally, I was involved in two research projects about SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and nucleosome formation. In order to support myself financially, I worked as a teaching assistant for three semesters.', \"Although I had the option of doing a doctoral degree at Columbia, my department had a molecular bent, making it incompatible with my burgeoning interest in systems-level problems. I left Columbia with an MS degree and returned to England, transferring to the University of Southampton. In my years as a PhD candidate, I formulated a theory to explain lymphatic development. In the process, I learnt aspects of mathematical biology and applied mathematics. This period saw my growth into an independent and confident member of society. I partially made up for my embarrassment of not having worked part-time at school and university. At one point, I had three jobs on top of my degree. I also endured a cancer scare, took up painting, and began an amateur chess career. Towards the end of my graduate studies, as my views became clear, I intended to adopt the name 11250205 for the person I had become. First, like the transhumanist FM-2030, I wanted to protest against humanity's collectivist mentality. Second, I wanted to protect the Chinese culture from appropriation. As the Home Office would sadly not recognise it, I took my current name in tribute to three people who had shaped me, to the belief that genuine human touches matter more than imposed ties. A few years later, it dawned on me that the Home Office is just another institution, so I began to go by the name of 11250205 too.\", \"After becoming a doctor in bioengineering, I concluded that the stuggle to comprehend and manage complexity would define the 21st century. I was convinced that scientific computing was the best hope in this endeavour. I moved to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the American Midwest to take my quest in this new direction. I moved into my unfurnished apartment with around 200 USD in my bank account, but thanks to the university's campus card, I made it through the first month. In the next two years, I led the ambitious project of building a virtual immune system and living the good life in the Cornhusker State. In the course of the project, I supervised two PhD candidates and three undergraduate students. I also continued my education by completing two programmes: a whole-cell modelling workshop at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona and Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. In chess, I won the open U1600 section of the 2018 Cornhusker State Games: my first trophy.\", \"After laying the foundation of the virtual immune system—an achievement that won me the International Intellectual Benefits to Society Award from the Mensa Foundation—I wanted a new challenge, so I moved to the University of Sheffield to join PRIMAGE, a 10 million–euro Horizon 2020 project involving 16 institutions from eight European countries. We developed a cloud-based decision-making platform for the clinical management of malignant solid tumours. To this end, I built the first multicellular computational model of neuroblastoma and modelled DIPG's invasive spread.\", \"In parallel to PRIMAGE, I conceived three projects about the origin, nature, and treatment of neuroblastoma; secured small grants; and recruited students for the projects. In total, I supervised a PhD candidate, a master's student, and eight undergraduate students in Sheffield. I also established international collaborations with the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy and St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute in Austria. In order to bolster my skill set, I took a series of bioinformatics courses offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. In 2021, I taught a part of the course titled Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems at the university.\", 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had time for introspection. Reflecting on my firsthand experience of intersectional discrimination crystallised my long-standing concern for social justice in academia. In 2020, I joined the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Committee of the Department of Computer Science, contributing a little to the renewal of its Athena SWAN Silver Award for another five years in 2021. I became increasingly conscious of patriarchy too, including my own complicity in it. This process culminated in my outright rejection of all genders and hence my male privileges in late 2021.', 'In January 2023, I joined the University of Hull as a lecturer (assistant professor): my first independent academic position. At the Centre of Excellence for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Modelling, I am running a research programme investigating biological and social systems. In parallel, I passively offer consultancy services to researchers who require AI expertise for their projects, mostly in healthcare and biomedical research.', 'My department delivers a conversion MSc degree programme in artificial intelligence and data science. I teach the Applied AI module and give guest lectures on cancer modelling. Furthermore, I propose and/or supervise a broad range of dissertation projects every academic year. In preparation for my teaching duties, I have completed courses in computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, generative AI, and reinforcement learning via Udacity and Coursera. In February 2024, I became a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.', \"Immediately after moving to Hull, I became my department's EDI champion to continue my advocacy and began my 200-hour yoga teacher training with Ann-Marie Mainprize. In October 2023, 15 years after my first yoga class, I became a qualified instructor.

I went way beyond my comfort zone by taking graduate-level courses in other departments even though I did not have the prerequisites, including partial differential equations (applied maths), statistical mechanics (applied physics), quantitative methods in cell biology (interdisciplinary), and molecular biophysics (biochemistry and molecular biophysics). I developed my research interests further through research projects in the areas of biophysics, image analysis, and molecular simulation. After passing my qualifying examination and getting the MS degree, I was offered the option to pursue a funded doctoral degree in the department. However, I transferred to Southampton to work on developmental biology after fall 2013.', \"Between 2008 and 2012, I was an undergraduate student at Imperial College London, where I received a solid education in chemical engineering, including courses, lab work, and group projects. I also took an elective course in biomechanics in the bioengineering department. In my final year, I was involved in two major projects. In the first term, a lab partner and I completed a research project about Alzheimer's disease. In the second term, I worked with nine coursemates to design a process with an annual capacity of 515 tonnes of S-ibuprofen–S-lysine. Throughout the degree, I was inspired by my personal tutor, Doctor Jawahar Krishnan, to develop my interest in theoretical biology. I helped run the yoga club at Imperial too. I graduated with an integrated master's degree.\", 'On the strength of my academic excellence and performance at a panel interview, I was awarded a tuition fee waiver (50 %) by Imperial College London to spend the 2010–2011 academic year at the University of Sydney in Australia. In addition to chemical engineering courses, I took electives in biochemical engineering, cellular biophysics, and membrane science. During the Christmas/summer holiday, I worked in a tissue engineering research group. My grade was converted by Imperial College London according to an official scale.', 'From 2006 to 2008, I attended Sevenoaks School, a boarding school in the UK. I studied mathematics (higher level), chemistry (higher level), biology (higher level), economics (standard level), Mandarin (standard level B), English literature (standard level A1), and theory of knowledge.

A complex system has an extra constraint; its properties and behaviours cannot be predicted from those of its components in isolation. They arise from intercomponent interactions in a phenomenon known as emergence.', \"Four important emergent behaviours are self-organisation, hysteresis, adaptation, and nonlinearity. Self-organisation means unplanned order; hysteresis means a system's state depends on its history; adaptation results in resilience despite environmental changes; nonlinearity means a systemic output is not proportional to a relevant environmental input.

Using the model, she is now investigating the effects of inhibiting different interconversion pathways on clonal evolution during treatment. Typically, noradrenergic neuroblastoma cells are more sensitive to treatment, but Dr Taschner-Mandl is developing mesenchymal phenotype–specific inhibitors. The goal is to manipulate a tumour's interconversion dynamics to steer its evolution towards a state where it is vulnerable to certain drugs.\", 'Other phenomena await explanation too. Most if not all of the existing models of adaptive therapy consider two drugs only, but the rapid COJEC protocol for induction chemotherapy alone requires five drugs.

On the other hand, uncontrolled platelet activation could result in thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel, which obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system.

This is not surprising because it activates genes involved in metastasis, survival, proliferation, pluripotency, self-renewal, and angiogenesis, while switching off genes involved in differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and immune surveillance. However, the abundance of MYCN's mRNA in a tumour is a non-linear prognostic indicator. The MYCN enigma is the general observation that a patient's clinical outcome does not linearly depend on whether the gene is amplified and the abundance of its mRNA in their neuroblastoma cells.\", 'During the PRIMAGE project, I conceived this side project to find a theoretical solution to the MYCN enigma. Specifically, I wanted to develop an explanation in terms of the fact that MYCN activates p53 (a tumour suppressor gene) through the ARF/MDM2/p53 axis. In order to fund it, I secured two Insigneo research grants.', 'In the summer of 2019, I recruited Daniel Jordan, a mechatronics and robotics engineering undergraduate student, to work on the project at the University of Sheffield.

He also experimented with spectral and fractal analysis tools.', \"In 2023, I recruited Matteo Italia, a PhD candidate under Dr Fabio Dercole at the Polytechnic University of Milan. We hypothesised that the protein level of p53 relative to that of MYCN determines a neuroblastoma cell's fate. We parameterised the model with literature values before conducting a global sensitivity analysis. We partitioned the simulation results into different categories based on our hypothesis and compared each set of results with experimental datasets. We also applied the Apriori algorithm to find association rules in each set of simulation results.\", 'Overall, the simulation results align with numerous findings in the literature, including both broad observations and specific experimental results.

This video explains the PRIMAGE project's relevance to the clinical management of paediatric cancers:link.\", 'Based at the University of Sheffield, I modelled two paediatric cancers at the cellular scale under the supervision of Doctor Dawn Walker.', 'I built a computational model of neuroblastoma by combining a continuous automaton, autonomous agents, and a centre-based mechanical model.', \"The continuous automaton, which is a generalised cellular automaton, divides the tumour into voxels. Each voxel is associated with an amount of extracellular matrix, a neuroblastoma cell count, and a Schwann cell count. The grid is itself associated with a homogeneous amount of oxygen and nutrients, as well as an extent of inflammation. The major agent behaviours are cell cycling and cell death. These are regulated by the microenvironment and each agent's internal attributes. For example, hypoxia can damage an agent's DNA and thus induce apoptosis, but the agent can repair its DNA if p53 is active. Some of the regulatory mechanisms are double-edged. For example, an apoptotic or necrotic agent is easier to remove in a more inflamed microenvironment, but inflammation also leads to further necrosis. The two agent populations interact via the continuous automaton, which records their spatial distributions. While neuroblastoma cells promote cell cycle progression in Schwann cells, Schwann cells induce apoptosis and differentiation in neuroblastoma cells; a more differentiated neuroblastoma cell is less proliferative. When two agents overlap, contact inhibition stops cell cycling and matrix production. The centre-based mechanical model resolves the conflict.\", \"Then, I aggregated data about neuroblastoma's histology, mutations, hypoxia, and growth kinetics. Together, the tumour's histology type and mutation profile determine the split between the two agent populations, the differentiation state of the neuroblastoma cell population, their ability to repair telomeres, and their cell cycling rate. I developed a tournament-style pipeline based on Latin hypercube sampling to calibrate the model on the basis of the aggregated data.\", \"Using the calibrated model, I simulated the dynamics of clonal competition within heterogeneous tumours and evaluated combinations of targeted therapies on the GPUs on the Bessemer high-performance computing cluster. I analysed the resulting datasets by dimensionality reduction, clustering, and hypothesis testing. I theorised about an unconventional therapy based on targeting p53's regulators. Althoughp53is usually considered a tumour suppressor gene, the protein it encodes repairs damaged DNA too. My theory is that p53 is on balance pro-apoptosis in most neuroblastoma cells, but a typical tumour contains a small portion of cells wherein it is pro-survival. It follows from my theory that the usual strategy of activatingp53and stabilising p53 is incomplete. An adaptive approach is worth exploring.\", 'To accelerate the costly simulations, I built surrogate models by multiple linear regression and deep learning.', 'In parallel, I collaborated with the University of Zaragoza, University of Bologna, and Chemotargets SL to integrate the calibrated model with their organ-scale and single-cell models with a new scale separation method.', 'In June 2021, Will Shaw, a computer science undergraduate student at our university, joined Dr Walker and me for a summer project funded by the SURE (Sheffield Undergraduate Research Experiences) scheme.

He used four ordinary differential equations inspired by the logistic function to model neuroblastoma's clonal evolution under the selective pressures exerted by etoposide and cisplatin. Then, he fitted the model to experimental data in the literature using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and designed a genetic algorithm to optimise the combination of the two drugs.\", \"After Ritvik's thesis research, I established international collaborations with Dr Fabio Dercole from the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy and Dr Sabine Taschner-Mandl from St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute in Austria. Under our supervision, Matteo Italia, Dr Dercole's PhD student (engineering mathematics), modified and expanded Ritvik's model to consider clonal competition, mutation, pharmacokinetics, and the drugs' cytotoxic effects. In the final model, each clone has its own fitness, proliferation rate, and drug sensitivities; and it can adapt to a drug at the expense of proliferation. As he found more relevant data on vincristine and cyclophosphamide than etoposide and cisplatin, Matteo calibrated the model to describe the former pair.\", \"Then, we used genetic and gradient descent algorithms to optimise induction chemotherapy, the first stage of the multimodal therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma patients. We discovered different evolutionary dynamics in tumours with different resistance profiles. According to the results, when two drugs are differentially cytotoxic, administering both at their maximum tolerated doses is not always the best strategy. The best strategy depends on each drug's relative cytotoxicity, each clone's sensitivity to each drug, and the precise clonal composition.\", 'In the broader context of precision medicine for neuroblastoma, our results suggest that evolutionary dynamics are patient-specific and as a result, personalised schedules are needed to exploit clonal competition optimally to minimise the tumour size. As chemotherapy is known to enrich mutations, not only can this approach optimise induction chemotherapy, but it can also drive the tumour into an evolutionary trap and extinction vortex simultaneously. Immediately after the optimised induction phase, the remaining small and scattered populations of cancer cells will be vulnerable to therapies targeting the enriched mutations.', 'We finished the project in December 2022.', 'Copyright ©\\xa02017–2024 Kenneth Y.

He searched for attractors under a synchronous updating scheme and an asynchronous one. He reproduced two experiments: the model's inductive signals upregulated the specifiers therein and a knock-down experiment.\", 'The neural border specifiers were known to switch off after the second step, so he perturbed an attractor by withdrawing the inductive signals and overexpressing MYCN in the model. Despite an upregulated MYCN, the neural border specifiers failed to stay active in the model. It is possible that MYCN amplification does not impair the first two steps. However, a more plausible reason is that some regulatory mechanisms are elusive. Related is the fact that multiple events occur in each step; their regulatory mechanisms overlap but differ.', \"After considering Jack's results, I decided to switch to a bottom-up approach and focus on a well-characterised fundamental process carried out by neural crest progenitor cells: asymmetric division.\", \"In 2022, Alvaro Andre Yupanqui Rivera, an undergraduate bioengineer, joined the project as an Insigneo summer intern.

      "['I am a systems theorist with expertise in mathematical modelling, scientific computing, and machine learning. Biological and social systems are my main interests, but I develop applications of artificial intelligence too. When I am not theorising, I advocate linguistic justice and teach yoga.', 'Aracial, acultural, and agender, I am a global citizen without a home country, but I am currently based in Kingston upon Hull in the UK. My correct pronouns are they and them. I am also known as 11250205.', 'If you want to contact me, please find my email address here:link.', 'I am a neurodivergent (autism), a global citizen, and an agender person.', \"Please do not make assumptions about me, but do acknowledge the reality I am in. To me, the concepts of nationality, race, gender, and age; cultures and religions; and the institutions of marriage and family are relics of humanity's tribal past. I do not approve of what creates conflicts and hinders evolution, so I do not define myself in such terms.\", 'Please do not enquire about my origin. Being aracial and acultural, I do not have a home country and I refuse to celebrate any festivals. If you really need to know for practical reasons, the UK is my passport country. If you are a racist and as such need to know more, I am originally from Ethiopia: the cradle ofHomo sapiens. Let us recognise our common roots in Africa.', 'There are similarities between my belief in our potential to be more than our chromosomes and the transgender rights movement. It would therefore be hypocritical of me to not identify as non-binary in protest against patriarchy. My correct pronouns are they and them.', \"After an unremarkable childhood impeded by undiagnosed autism and my parents' mistake of sending me to school late, I immigrated from Hong Kong to the UK, but I refuse to be defined in relation to either place. My early development culminated in an angsty period at a boarding school in Kent. I was unhappy with the environment, but I could neither explain why nor change it. In retrospect, I was collecting data which I was not equipped to understand. Academically, I was very confused too. An internship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong introduced me to organic synthesis but put me off experimental work. On the other hand, my subject combination ruled out many theoretical disciplines. In the end, I picked chemical engineering only because it appeared to be an employable degree.\", \"Ironically, this uninspired choice led me to my intellectual home. At Imperial College London, I began to form my worldview, became a yogi, and developed an interest in theoretical biology. My fellow chemical engineers and I learnt a key lesson from our time together. Given the right circumstances, genuine solidarity in the face of seemingly unbridgeable differences is possible. In order to venture into the life sciences from my chemical engineering background, I did a series of interdisciplinary research projects. While in Australia as an exchange student at the University of Sydney, I worked in bone tissue engineering. During an internship at the National University of La Plata in Argentina, I built quantitative structure-activity relationship models for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In my final year, I built a dynamic model of the unfolded protein response in the context of Alzheimer's disease. I left Imperial with an MEng degree and more importantly, a desire to understand life in every sense of the word.\", 'I started my quest to understand life in New York City on a shoestring budget. At Columbia University, I studied chemical engineering from a more theoretical perspective and was introduced to biophysics. Additionally, I was involved in two research projects about SNARE-mediated membrane fusion and nucleosome formation. In order to support myself financially, I worked as a teaching assistant for three semesters.', \"Although I had the option of doing a doctoral degree at Columbia, my department had a molecular bent, making it incompatible with my burgeoning interest in systems-level problems. I left Columbia with an MS degree and returned to England, transferring to the University of Southampton. In my years as a PhD candidate, I formulated a theory to explain lymphatic development. In the process, I learnt aspects of mathematical biology and applied mathematics. This period saw my growth into an independent and confident member of society. I partially made up for my embarrassment of not having worked part-time at school and university. At one point, I had three jobs on top of my degree. I also endured a cancer scare, took up painting, and began an amateur chess career. Towards the end of my graduate studies, as my views became clear, I intended to adopt the name 11250205 for the person I had become. First, like the transhumanist FM-2030, I wanted to protest against humanity's collectivist mentality. Second, I wanted to protect the Chinese culture from appropriation. As the Home Office would sadly not recognise it, I took my current name in tribute to three people who had shaped me, to the belief that genuine human touches matter more than imposed ties. A few years later, it dawned on me that the Home Office is just another institution, so I began to go by the name of 11250205 too.\", \"After becoming a doctor in bioengineering, I concluded that the stuggle to comprehend and manage complexity would define the 21st century. I was convinced that scientific computing was the best hope in this endeavour. I moved to the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the American Midwest to take my quest in this new direction. I moved into my unfurnished apartment with around 200 USD in my bank account, but thanks to the university's campus card, I made it through the first month. In the next two years, I led the ambitious project of building a virtual immune system and living the good life in the Cornhusker State. In the course of the project, I supervised two PhD candidates and three undergraduate students. I also continued my education by completing two programmes: a whole-cell modelling workshop at the Centre for Genomic Regulation in Barcelona and Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. In chess, I won the open U1600 section of the 2018 Cornhusker State Games: my first trophy.\", \"After laying the foundation of the virtual immune system—an achievement that won me the International Intellectual Benefits to Society Award from the Mensa Foundation—I wanted a new challenge, so I moved to the University of Sheffield to join PRIMAGE, a 10 million–euro Horizon 2020 project involving 16 institutions from eight European countries. We developed a cloud-based decision-making platform for the clinical management of malignant solid tumours. To this end, I built the first multicellular computational model of neuroblastoma and modelled DIPG's invasive spread.\", \"In parallel to PRIMAGE, I conceived three projects about the origin, nature, and treatment of neuroblastoma; secured small grants; and recruited students for the projects. In total, I supervised a PhD candidate, a master's student, and eight undergraduate students in Sheffield. I also established international collaborations with the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy and St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute in Austria. In order to bolster my skill set, I took a series of bioinformatics courses offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. In 2021, I taught a part of the course titled Modelling and Simulation of Natural Systems at the university.\", 'During the COVID-19 pandemic, I had time for introspection. Reflecting on my firsthand experience of intersectional discrimination crystallised my long-standing concern for social justice in academia. In 2020, I joined the Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Committee of the Department of Computer Science, contributing a little to the renewal of its Athena SWAN Silver Award for another five years in 2021. I became increasingly conscious of patriarchy too, including my own complicity in it. This process culminated in my outright rejection of all genders and hence my male privileges in late 2021.', 'In January 2023, I joined the University of Hull as a lecturer (assistant professor): my first independent academic position. At the Centre of Excellence for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Modelling, I am running a research programme investigating biological and social systems. In parallel, I passively offer consultancy services to researchers who require AI expertise for their projects, mostly in healthcare and biomedical research.', 'My department delivers a conversion MSc degree programme in artificial intelligence and data science. I teach the Applied AI module and give guest lectures on cancer modelling. Furthermore, I propose and/or supervise a broad range of dissertation projects every academic year. In preparation for my teaching duties, I have completed courses in computer vision, NLP, speech recognition, generative AI, and reinforcement learning via Udacity and Coursera. In February 2024, I became a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy.', \"Immediately after moving to Hull, I became my department's EDI champion to continue my advocacy and began my 200-hour yoga teacher training with Ann-Marie Mainprize. In October 2023, 15 years after my first yoga class, I became a qualified instructor. At the University of Hull, I have raised awareness of EDI issues such as linguistic justice and microaggressions, speaking at internal conferences, giving departmental seminars, and leading induction sessions.\", 'I worked with Professor Tiina Roose during my doctoral research at the University of Southampton in the UK. In this period, I was supported by an EPSRC studentship awarded by the Faculty of Engineering and the Environment; it covered my tuition, research-related expenses, and a stipend. To facilitate my thesis research, I took courses in numerical methods and mathematical biology in the mathematics department. I was also involved in the yoga society and chess club at the university. I defended my thesis successfully less than three years after starting the degree in February in 2014. My thesis title isMathematical Modelling of Lymphangiogenesis.', 'When I was a graduate student at Columbia University in the City of New York in the USA, I was supported by a departmental scholarship, which covered my tuition, fees, and a stipend. I took advanced courses in transport phenomena, chemical kinetics, and thermodynamics, as well as a general research methodology course in my department. I went way beyond my comfort zone by taking graduate-level courses in other departments even though I did not have the prerequisites, including partial differential equations (applied maths), statistical mechanics (applied physics), quantitative methods in cell biology (interdisciplinary), and molecular biophysics (biochemistry and molecular biophysics). I developed my research interests further through research projects in the areas of biophysics, image analysis, and molecular simulation. After passing my qualifying examination and getting the MS degree, I was offered the option to pursue a funded doctoral degree in the department. However, I transferred to Southampton to work on developmental biology after fall 2013.', \"Between 2008 and 2012, I was an undergraduate student at Imperial College London, where I received a solid education in chemical engineering, including courses, lab work, and group projects. I also took an elective course in biomechanics in the bioengineering department. In my final year, I was involved in two major projects. In the first term, a lab partner and I completed a research project about Alzheimer's disease. In the second term, I worked with nine coursemates to design a process with an annual capacity of 515 tonnes of S-ibuprofen–S-lysine. Throughout the degree, I was inspired by my personal tutor, Doctor Jawahar Krishnan, to develop my interest in theoretical biology. I helped run the yoga club at Imperial too. I graduated with an integrated master's degree.\", 'On the strength of my academic excellence and performance at a panel interview, I was awarded a tuition fee waiver (50 %) by Imperial College London to spend the 2010–2011 academic year at the University of Sydney in Australia. In addition to chemical engineering courses, I took electives in biochemical engineering, cellular biophysics, and membrane science. During the Christmas/summer holiday, I worked in a tissue engineering research group. My grade was converted by Imperial College London according to an official scale.', 'From 2006 to 2008, I attended Sevenoaks School, a boarding school in the UK. I studied mathematics (higher level), chemistry (higher level), biology (higher level), economics (standard level), Mandarin (standard level B), English literature (standard level A1), and theory of knowledge. While researching for my extended essay, I used high-performance liquid chromatography to find out the caffeine levels in different energy drinks. I won the Science Faculty, GlaxoSmithKline Science, and Mathematics Prizes. I was a part of the school ground force and the chairman of my house. In 2007, I took part in the UK Senior Mathematical Challenge and won a gold certificate, thus earning an invitation to participate in the 2007/08 British Mathematical Olympiad. I also entered a science essay competition organised by Peterhouse, Cambridge and won a commendation.', 'I completed this Udacity course in December 2024. After learning how reinforcement learning problems can be modelled as Markov decision processes, I learnt value-based methods for policy optimisation, including the Monte Carlo control method, Sarsa, Sarsamax (Q-learning), expected Sarsa, and deep Q-learning.', 'After that, I completed another uncertified course. I learnt policy-based methods, including hill climbing, steepest ascent hill climbing, simulated annealing, adaptive noise scaling, the cross-entropy method, evolution strategies, REINFORCE (policy gradient method), and proximal policy optimisation. I also learnt to combine value-based and policy-based methods in actor-critic methods, including A3C and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm.', 'I completed this Udacity course in September 2024. I was introduced to the automatic speech recognition pipeline, including audio signal analysis (spectrogram and MFCC), acoustic modelling (hidden Markov models), language modelling (N-grams), deep neural networks, and connectionist temporal classification.', 'I completed this Udacity course in August 2024. I learnt to use region-based CNNs and YOLO for object detection, as well as RNN-CNN models for image captioning.', \"In July 2024, I completed MHFA England's two-day mental health first aid course. I learnt the role of a mental health first aider, what mental health is, some signs of poor/ill mental health, some risk/protective factors associated with poor/good mental health, self-care, and the ALGEE action plan. I learnt some tools to implement the action plan too, including active listening, the focus technique, and helpful language about mental health.\", 'In November and December 2023, I was introduced to the fundamentals of computer vision in this Udacity course, such as colour space conversions, smoothing, edge detection, shape detection (Hough transform and corner detection), erosion, dilation, image segmentation (contouring and clustering), object recognition (Haar cascades), and feature extraction (ORB and HOG). Then, I learnt to build convolutional neural networks and visualise their features.', 'In September and October 2023, I learnt to build various types of generative adversarial networks in this Udacity course, including the basic GAN, DCGAN, CGAN, CycleGAN, WGAN, WGAN-GP, ProGAN, and StyleGAN.', 'I completed my training under the tutelage of Ann-Marie Mainprize in 2023. My peers and I spent 10 months studying over 120asanasand therapeutic techniques, intelligent sequencing,pranayama, meditation and relaxation techniques, functional anatomy, subtle anatomy, physiology, and yoga philosophy. Through micro-teaching and receiving feedback from each other, we developed practical skills in demonstration, providing verbal cues, alignment awareness, adjustment, and modification. In October 2023, 15 years after my first yoga class, I was certified by Yoga Alliance Professionals as a registered yoga teacher 200RYT. This accreditation is an internationally recognised qualification.', 'In the summer of 2023, I completed a series of NLP courses offered by DeepLearning.AI via Coursera. In the first course, I mastered the fundamentals of NLP, including text preprocessing techniques, logistic regression (sentiment analysis), Naive Bayes classification (sentiment analysis), word vectors (embeddings), principal component analysis, the bag-of-words model, the k-nearest neighbours algorithm, and locality-sensitive hashing. In the second course, I learnt to use dynamic programming for autocorrection, hidden Markov models for part-of-speech tagging, n-grams language models to autocomplete sentences, and CBOW models to compute word embeddings. In the third course, I became conversant with the use of deep neural networks for NLP. I built a feedforward network for sentiment analysis, a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units for autocompletion, a long short-term memory network to locate and classify named entities, and a Siamese network comprising two LSTM subnetworks to identify duplicate questions. In the final course, I was introduced to the attention mechanism and several transformers. I built an encoder-decoder model comprising LSTMs and the scaled dot product attention mechanism for English-to-German translation, a transformer decoder using the masked self-attention (autoregressive or causal attention) mechanism for text summarisation, a transformer encoder (BERT) for question answering, and a chatbot based on the reformer model.', 'At different points in 2020 and 2021, I took a set of bioinformatics courses offered by Johns Hopkins University via Coursera. I learnt about genomic technologies such as WGS, WES, RNASeq, ChIPSeq, and bisulfite sequencing; algorithms for sequence alignment and assembly; bioinformatics pipelines such as variant calling and the Tuxedo pipeline for RNASeq data; biostatistics; and bioinformatics tools including the Galaxy platform, Bash scripting, Bioconductor, R, and Python. I secured a development opportunity grant from the Engineering Researcher Society of the University of Sheffield to fund the courses.', 'Between March and November in 2018, I completed this Udacity programme.

A system consists of components interacting within its boundary with the rest of the universe (environment). A complex system has an extra constraint; its properties and behaviours cannot be predicted from those of its components in isolation. They arise from intercomponent interactions in a phenomenon known as emergence.', \"Four important emergent behaviours are self-organisation, hysteresis, adaptation, and nonlinearity. Self-organisation means unplanned order; hysteresis means a system's state depends on its history; adaptation results in resilience despite environmental changes; nonlinearity means a systemic output is not proportional to a relevant environmental input. They are possible because of properties such as agency, heterogeneity, control loops, nested structures, and open boundaries.\", 'Complex systems are found in many disciplines. Prominent examples include chemical plants, embryos, immune systems, tumours, nervous systems, ecosystems, stock markets, social groups, and languages. I mostly study biological and social systems, but I develop applications of artificial intelligence too.', 'Although I identify as aracial, acultural, and agender—a global citizen without a home country—I cannot prevent people from stereotyping me as an East Asian male.

I will paint again one day.', 'In summer 2024, I helped Linhao Chen, a visiting PhD candidate (philosophy) from South China Normal University, secure funding from the China Scholarship Council. Supported by the scholarship, Linhao moved to Hull in October 2024 to spend a year with me and Dr Dionysios Demetis (Hull University Business School).', \"We are investigating equality issues in linguistically diverse communities.

The most famous example is adaptive therapy, which uses treatment-sensitive cancer cells to suppress their resistant peers. This project aims to investigate evolutionary therapy in the context of neuroblastoma.', \"After conceiving the project, I established an international collaboration with Dr Sabine Taschner-Mandl from St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute.

In January 2024, Francesca Covell became our first PhD candidate (AI and Data Science).\", \"Fran is interested in neuroblastoma's phenotypic plasticity in this context. She has already built a model describing neuroblastoma cells' interconversion between the noradrenergic, intermediate, and mesenchymal identities with ordinary differential equations. Using the model, she is now investigating the effects of inhibiting different interconversion pathways on clonal evolution during treatment. Typically, noradrenergic neuroblastoma cells are more sensitive to treatment, but Dr Taschner-Mandl is developing mesenchymal phenotype–specific inhibitors. The goal is to manipulate a tumour's interconversion dynamics to steer its evolution towards a state where it is vulnerable to certain drugs.\", 'Other phenomena await explanation too. Most if not all of the existing models of adaptive therapy consider two drugs only, but the rapid COJEC protocol for induction chemotherapy alone requires five drugs. Multidrug adaptive therapy can certainly benefit from a more general theoretical framework. Spatial and stochastic effects, as well as various non-cancer cells in the tumour microenvironment, complicate the dynamics further.', 'In January 2023, I joined the University of Hull as a lecturer (assistant professor) at the Centre of Excellence for Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Modelling. Influenced by this intellectual environment, I began to work in applied artificial intelligence in parallel to systems research.', \"I am the secondary supervisor of Gulraiz Khan, a PhD candidate. He developed a deep learning framework to predict the facial landmarks, ages, and genders of human face images. It has a backbone model (ResNet-18) for feature extraction. It is linked to three branches of lightweight neural networks, which share the convolutional feature maps produced by the backbone model in response to an image. They predict the image's facial landmarks, age, and gender respectively. He is now solving the problem of real-time, identity-aware, and clothing-aware 3D reconstruction.\", 'Platelets are small blood cells that play a key role in blood clotting (haemostasis). On the other hand, uncontrolled platelet activation could result in thrombosis, the formation of a blood clot inside a blood vessel, which obstructs the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Multiple stimulatory and inhibitory signalling pathways interact within a platelet to enable it to adapt to a changing extracellular environment. For example, its proteome may change in response to oxidative stresses. Dr Giordano Pula (Hull York Medical School) and I are interested in identifying such changes and then interpreting them in functional terms.', 'In diabetics, platelets are known to be hyper-responsive and responsible for cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral tissue ischemia. In the autumn trimester in 2023, Shaon Biswas conducted his MSc dissertation research (AI and Data Science) under our supervision at the University of Hull. He used the Enrichr library, the KEGG database, and the UniProt database to identify the platelet proteins associated with cardiovascular complications in a proteomic dataset pertaining to 23 diabetic (type 2) patients and 24 controls. Using this list of proteins as his reference, he combined standard differential expression analysis with protein-protein network analysis (STRING database), feature importance analysis (random forest classification), clustering, principal component analysis, and association rule learning to identify novel platelet protein biomarkers of cardiovascular complications in diabetics.', 'Our MSc degree programme in artificial intelligence and data science includes a dissertation project. Throughout the academic year, I propose and/or supervise these projects. Sometimes, our students design their own projects.

Enoch Appiah built an image processing pipeline and a CNN-LSTM model to digitise handwritten clinical notes. He won the Best MSc Research Project Prize. Folakemi Fatiregun built an AI system to allocate hospital beds. Partly on the strength of her impressive dissertation, she secured a full-time position as an information analyst at the same NHS trust.', 'In the autumn trimester of 2023, I supervised 12 projects.

Esther Chukwuezi experimented with diverse dimensionality reduction techniques to optimise risk prediction based on cardiopulmonary exercise testing data about people with heart failure.', \"In the summer trimester of 2024, I supervised three projects, including two collaborative projects with Spencer Group, a civil engineering company in Hull. Within the framework of retrieval-augmented generation, Duy Thanh Do used the company's database of emails and documents to optimise the outputs of large language models, giving them the ability to produce summaries of project milestones. Working with the same database, Olalekan Akindele used knowledge graphs to enhance retrieval-augmented generation, turning large language models into chatbots. Olalekan won the Best MSc Research Project Prize.\", \"When the MYCN gene (an oncogene) is amplified in neuroblastoma cells, it is a biomarker indicative of adverse outcomes. This is not surprising because it activates genes involved in metastasis, survival, proliferation, pluripotency, self-renewal, and angiogenesis, while switching off genes involved in differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and immune surveillance. However, the abundance of MYCN's mRNA in a tumour is a non-linear prognostic indicator. The MYCN enigma is the general observation that a patient's clinical outcome does not linearly depend on whether the gene is amplified and the abundance of its mRNA in their neuroblastoma cells.\", 'During the PRIMAGE project, I conceived this side project to find a theoretical solution to the MYCN enigma. Specifically, I wanted to develop an explanation in terms of the fact that MYCN activates p53 (a tumour suppressor gene) through the ARF/MDM2/p53 axis. In order to fund it, I secured two Insigneo research grants.', 'In the summer of 2019, I recruited Daniel Jordan, a mechatronics and robotics engineering undergraduate student, to work on the project at the University of Sheffield. Together, we used a set of ordinary differential equations to model the crosstalk between MYCN and the ARF/MDM2/p53 axis, and performed a basic analysis on the fixed points.', 'In the academic year 2019–2020, Melody Parker, an MSc computational medicine student at the University of Sheffield, joined the project for her dissertation research. Under the supervision of Dr Dawn Walker and me, she picked up where Dan had left off, enriching the model with mechanistic details concerning various stages in the flow of genetic information. Using eight equations containing highly non-linear terms such as the Hill function, she modelled the dynamics within a gene regulatory network representing these mechanisms.', 'In the summer of 2021, Rory Deignan, an undergraduate (theoretical physics) at the University of Sheffield, built computational tools for a large-scale stability analysis of the model. He combined Latin hypercube sampling with the Newton-Raphson algorithm to find physical and well-scaled fixed points and classify them. He also experimented with spectral and fractal analysis tools.', \"In 2023, I recruited Matteo Italia, a PhD candidate under Dr Fabio Dercole at the Polytechnic University of Milan. We hypothesised that the protein level of p53 relative to that of MYCN determines a neuroblastoma cell's fate. We parameterised the model with literature values before conducting a global sensitivity analysis. We partitioned the simulation results into different categories based on our hypothesis and compared each set of results with experimental datasets. We also applied the Apriori algorithm to find association rules in each set of simulation results.\", 'Overall, the simulation results align with numerous findings in the literature, including both broad observations and specific experimental results. Most importantly, by partitioning the simulation results according to our hypothesis, we were able to reproduce an experimental dataset closely associated with the MYCN enigma.', \"Between February 2019 and December 2022, I was a part of this 10 million–euro Horizon 2020 project. It was launched by 16 institutions from eight European countries to build a cloud-based decision-making platform for the clinical management of malignant solid tumours, specifically predictive tools for diagnosis, prognosis, therapeutic choices, and treatment follow-up, including novel imaging biomarkers,in silicotumour growth simulation methods, advanced visualisation techniques, and machine learning tools. This video explains the PRIMAGE project's relevance to the clinical management of paediatric cancers:link.\", 'Based at the University of Sheffield, I modelled two paediatric cancers at the cellular scale under the supervision of Doctor Dawn Walker.', 'I built a computational model of neuroblastoma by combining a continuous automaton, autonomous agents, and a centre-based mechanical model.', \"The continuous automaton, which is a generalised cellular automaton, divides the tumour into voxels. Each voxel is associated with an amount of extracellular matrix, a neuroblastoma cell count, and a Schwann cell count. The grid is itself associated with a homogeneous amount of oxygen and nutrients, as well as an extent of inflammation. The major agent behaviours are cell cycling and cell death. These are regulated by the microenvironment and each agent's internal attributes. For example, hypoxia can damage an agent's DNA and thus induce apoptosis, but the agent can repair its DNA if p53 is active. Some of the regulatory mechanisms are double-edged. For example, an apoptotic or necrotic agent is easier to remove in a more inflamed microenvironment, but inflammation also leads to further necrosis. The two agent populations interact via the continuous automaton, which records their spatial distributions. While neuroblastoma cells promote cell cycle progression in Schwann cells, Schwann cells induce apoptosis and differentiation in neuroblastoma cells; a more differentiated neuroblastoma cell is less proliferative. When two agents overlap, contact inhibition stops cell cycling and matrix production. The centre-based mechanical model resolves the conflict.\", \"Then, I aggregated data about neuroblastoma's histology, mutations, hypoxia, and growth kinetics. Together, the tumour's histology type and mutation profile determine the split between the two agent populations, the differentiation state of the neuroblastoma cell population, their ability to repair telomeres, and their cell cycling rate. I developed a tournament-style pipeline based on Latin hypercube sampling to calibrate the model on the basis of the aggregated data.\", \"Using the calibrated model, I simulated the dynamics of clonal competition within heterogeneous tumours and evaluated combinations of targeted therapies on the GPUs on the Bessemer high-performance computing cluster. I analysed the resulting datasets by dimensionality reduction, clustering, and hypothesis testing. I theorised about an unconventional therapy based on targeting p53's regulators. Althoughp53is usually considered a tumour suppressor gene, the protein it encodes repairs damaged DNA too. My theory is that p53 is on balance pro-apoptosis in most neuroblastoma cells, but a typical tumour contains a small portion of cells wherein it is pro-survival. It follows from my theory that the usual strategy of activatingp53and stabilising p53 is incomplete. An adaptive approach is worth exploring.\", 'To accelerate the costly simulations, I built surrogate models by multiple linear regression and deep learning.', 'In parallel, I collaborated with the University of Zaragoza, University of Bologna, and Chemotargets SL to integrate the calibrated model with their organ-scale and single-cell models with a new scale separation method.', 'In June 2021, Will Shaw, a computer science undergraduate student at our university, joined Dr Walker and me for a summer project funded by the SURE (Sheffield Undergraduate Research Experiences) scheme. He spent the summer reviewing the literature on diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) thoroughly.', \"In May 2022, Luke Jones, another undergraduate student from the same department, and I secured a bursary from the Sheffield Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) scheme. Based on the results of Will's review, we modelled DIPG's clonal evolution and invasive behaviour in a biological lattice-gas cellular automaton.\", 'I conceived this spin-off while working on PRIMAGE and secured an Insigneo research grant to fund it.', 'In the summer of 2020, I recruited Abigail Barlow, an MMath student at the University of Sheffield, to profile the drugs approved for neuroblastoma. After that, we learnt to use genetic algorithms to optimise drug combination and scheduling.', \"In the academic year 2020–2021, Ritvik Mehra carried out his undergraduate thesis research (computer science) at the University of Sheffield under Dr Dawn Walker's and my supervision. He used four ordinary differential equations inspired by the logistic function to model neuroblastoma's clonal evolution under the selective pressures exerted by etoposide and cisplatin. Then, he fitted the model to experimental data in the literature using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and designed a genetic algorithm to optimise the combination of the two drugs.\", \"After Ritvik's thesis research, I established international collaborations with Dr Fabio Dercole from the Polytechnic University of Milan in Italy and Dr Sabine Taschner-Mandl from St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute in Austria. Under our supervision, Matteo Italia, Dr Dercole's PhD student (engineering mathematics), modified and expanded Ritvik's model to consider clonal competition, mutation, pharmacokinetics, and the drugs' cytotoxic effects. In the final model, each clone has its own fitness, proliferation rate, and drug sensitivities; and it can adapt to a drug at the expense of proliferation. As he found more relevant data on vincristine and cyclophosphamide than etoposide and cisplatin, Matteo calibrated the model to describe the former pair.\", \"Then, we used genetic and gradient descent algorithms to optimise induction chemotherapy, the first stage of the multimodal therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma patients. We discovered different evolutionary dynamics in tumours with different resistance profiles. According to the results, when two drugs are differentially cytotoxic, administering both at their maximum tolerated doses is not always the best strategy. The best strategy depends on each drug's relative cytotoxicity, each clone's sensitivity to each drug, and the precise clonal composition.\", 'In the broader context of precision medicine for neuroblastoma, our results suggest that evolutionary dynamics are patient-specific and as a result, personalised schedules are needed to exploit clonal competition optimally to minimise the tumour size. As chemotherapy is known to enrich mutations, not only can this approach optimise induction chemotherapy, but it can also drive the tumour into an evolutionary trap and extinction vortex simultaneously. Immediately after the optimised induction phase, the remaining small and scattered populations of cancer cells will be vulnerable to therapies targeting the enriched mutations.', 'We finished the project in December 2022.', 'The neural crest is a transient population of multipotent cells in the vertebrate embryo. Its development spans gastrulation, neurulation, and organogenesis. It can be divided into five steps: neural border induction, neural crest induction, epithelium-to-mesenchyme transition (EMT), migration, and final differentiation into diverse tissues including the sympathoadrenal lineage.', 'It is known that amplification of the MYCN oncogene and activating mutations of the ALK oncogene can transform neural crest progenitor cells into neuroblastoma cells, which can interconvert between two phenotypes, N-type (adrenergic) and S-type (mesenchymal) cells, which have different levels of chemoresistance and invasive properties.', 'While working on the PRIMAGE project, I became interested in identifying the exact developmental step where this transformation occurs and explaining it in terms of intracellular molecular details. I conceived this project and secured an Insigneo research grant to fund it.', \"In the academic year 2019–2020, Jack Ashurst carried out his undergraduate thesis research (computer science) at the University of Sheffield. Doctor Dawn Walker and I co-supervised him. He modelled the first two steps with a top-down approach. Within a minimalist Boolean network, he connected the BMP, Wnt, FGF, and Notch signalling pathways to the neural border and neural crest specifiers, which constitute a gene regulatory network. He searched for attractors under a synchronous updating scheme and an asynchronous one. He reproduced two experiments: the model's inductive signals upregulated the specifiers therein and a knock-down experiment.\", 'The neural border specifiers were known to switch off after the second step, so he perturbed an attractor by withdrawing the inductive signals and overexpressing MYCN in the model. Despite an upregulated MYCN, the neural border specifiers failed to stay active in the model. It is possible that MYCN amplification does not impair the first two steps. However, a more plausible reason is that some regulatory mechanisms are elusive. Related is the fact that multiple events occur in each step; their regulatory mechanisms overlap but differ.', \"After considering Jack's results, I decided to switch to a bottom-up approach and focus on a well-characterised fundamental process carried out by neural crest progenitor cells: asymmetric division.\", \"In 2022, Alvaro Andre Yupanqui Rivera, an undergraduate bioengineer, joined the project as an Insigneo summer intern. Within a probabilistic Boolean network, we modelled the intracellular mechanism regulating this process. Using Tarjan's strongly connected components algorithm, we searched for ergodic sets with different input nodes knocked out. Each of them corresponds to a phenotype favouring asymmetric division or symmetric division.\", 'At this point, I decided to focus on advancing therapy for neuroblastoma rather than studying its origin, so I ended the project.', 'From March 2017 to January 2019, I led the development of a virtual immune system. The goal was to represent the constituting cells and molecules of the human immune system logically in space, time, and in relation to each other. The project was conceived and directed by Professor Tomas Helikar.', 'In the first phase of the project, I built a multiscale model of CD4+ T lymphocytes by leveraging logical modelling (Boolean networks), constraint-based modelling, agent-based modelling, and ordinary differential equations. In this model, the cells are represented by discrete agents and the relevant cytokines are described by continuous concentrations; both are distributed in three compartments representing the whole body. Within each agent, signal transduction, gene regulation, and metabolism are integrated in a logical model coupled to genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models.', 'I wrote an algorithm to implement the model, combining a Monte Carlo method, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, linear programming, and a finite difference method. Armed with this algorithm, I carried out computer simulations to validate the model and make predictions. Based on the results, I proposed novel emergent switch-like and oscillatory behaviours for CD4+ T cells.', 'In the second phase, I added more agent types to the framework encompassing the model, including neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, basophils, and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Although I left the project after laying the foundation of the virtual immune system, I remain available in a consulting capacity.', 'In the course of this project, I worked with two PhD candidates (Aimee Kessell and Sydney Townsend) and three undergraduate students (Alyssa La Fleur, Robert Moore, and Bailee Lichter).', 'Here is a presentation about this project:slidesandvideo recording.', \"Between March and November in 2018, I completed Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. After taking courses in supervised, unsupervised, deep, and reinforcement learning, I designed and implemented a capstone project, carrying out a series of studies using a dataset from a pan-cancer analysis of paediatric cancers.\", 'I built a series of classifiers to predict cancer histotypes and trained them with the dataset comprising activities of mutational signatures, including a decision tree, a naive Bayes classifier, support vector machines, an ensemble method (Adaboost), and a multilayer perceptron.', 'Additionally, I obtained biological insights from the dataset. I quantified the intra-histotype variations in it by hierarchical clustering and extracted latent features from it by principal component analysis.', 'Here are the results:reportandcode.', 'Between February 2014 and December 2016, I studied lymphangiogenesis (lymphatic development) in the zebrafish embryo under the supervision of Professor Tiina Roose.', \"I built a reaction-diffusion-convection model to describe the dynamics of VEGFC, MMP2, TIMP2, collagen I, and MT1-MMP in an idealised geometry representing the embryo's trunk; the model consists of 15 partial and ordinary differential equations. Aided by COMSOL Multiphysics, I carried out multiple numerical experiments by solving the model by the finite element method.\", 'After that, I simplified the model to four equations. In order to assess the potential of Turing pattern formation in the embryo, I wrote an algorithm to sample the parametric space of the simplified model.', 'Based on my results, I proposed a theory about lymphangiogenesis. According to my theory, VEGFC is a morphogen for the precursors of lymphatic endothelial cells, but a different molecule is needed to guide their migration. The patterning function of VEGFC depends on its interactions with collagen I and MMP2.', 'Here is a presentation about the project:link.', 'In my younger and more vulnerable years, I was very confused as to what I wanted from my career. Thanks to the generosity, patience, and tolerance of many mentors, I had the good fortune to dabble in an eclectic mix of research projects without the pressure of expectation.', \"In my second and third semesters (January to December 2013) at Columbia, I worked in Doctor Vanessa Ortiz's research group. I helped a senior colleague set up MD simulations and alchemical FEP calculations within NAMD. After analysing the data by TCL scripting, I predicted the solvent accessible surface areas of the phosphate groups and the nucleotide distributions in nucleosome-forming DNA fragments.\", \"In my first semester (September to December 2012) at Columbia University in the City of New York, I worked in Professor Ben O'Shaughnessy's research group. I worked with Doctor Ben Stratton, a PhD candidate then, to study SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. I used Speckle TrackerJ, an ImageJ plugin, to analyse TIRFM images of a microfluidic setup, quantifying lipid motion and vesicle fusion with a phospholipid bilayer. From the data, I calculated the average diffusion coefficient and bleaching time of lipid, and then inferred the vesicles' size distribution.\", \"In my final year at Imperial College London, I completed a research project under the supervision of Professor Cleo Kontoravdi. Between October and December in 2011, a lab partner and I constructed a mathematical model (ordinary differential equations) of the PERK-mediated branch of the unfolded protein response, and performed gPROMS-aided computer simulations of the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\", \"I was nominated by IAESTE UK and funded by IAESTE Argentina to intern at the Research Institute of Theoretical and Applied Physical Chemistry in La Plata, Argentina from July to September in 2011. Under the supervision of Professor Pablo Duchowicz and Doctor Andrew Mercader from Professor Eduardo Castro's group, I constructed 10 QSAR models by multiple linear regression. The models predict the activities of tacrine-related acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\", \"Between November 2010 and March 2011, I volunteered in Professor Hala Zreiqat's Biomaterial and Tissue Engineering Research Unit, a part of the University of Sydney. I worked with Doctor Iman Roohani, a PhD candidate then, to prepare strontium-doped magnesium silicate scaffolds for bone tissue engineering applications, and determine their chemical compositions by X-ray diffraction.\", \"I guess it was not exactly a research project. When I was still a sixth-former in the UK, I reached out to Professor Henry N.C. Wong in Hong Kong. After convincing him of my academic potential, I earned a paid internship at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Between July and August in 2007, I assisted Doctor Sam C.K.
